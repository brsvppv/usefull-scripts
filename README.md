# usefull-scripts

Purpose: a curated repo of small operational scripts and helpers, organized for cross-platform use and easy discovery.

Top-level layout

- `linux/` - distro-specific and common Linux scripts
- `windows/` - PowerShell, Batch and common Windows scripts
- `macos/` - macOS scripts and helpers
- `cross-platform/` - Python/NodeJS/other scripts that run on multiple OSes
- `docs/` - architecture, standards, and contribution guidelines
- `templates/` - starter templates for new scripts, configs


How to use

- Pick the OS folder, then the specific distro or `common/`.
- Add scripts with descriptive names. Include a small README in the folder explaining dependencies.
